# Trees Data Structure in JS

## Introduction
Trees are made up of nodes. In a binary tree, all parent nodes have 2 children nodes. The left child is always lesser than the parent node and the right child is always greater than the parent node. It is in this order that nodes are inserted 

## Use Cases
- Searching for a number

## Scalability
- Time Complexity: 
- Space Complexity:
