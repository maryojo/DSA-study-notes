# Tries Data Structure in JS

## Introduction
The word ‘trie’ is derived from the word retrieval. Tries are an ordered tree-like data structure efficient in handling programming problems related to strings.

It is also called a Prefix Tree or a Digital tree.

## Use Cases
- Dictionary word searches 
- Spell-checking 
- In search engines by making auto-complete suggestions

## Scalability
- Time Complexity: 
- Space Complexity:
